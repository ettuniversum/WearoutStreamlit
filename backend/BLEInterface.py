"""
Was able to fix this by myself. I'm publishing the code below. Basically, what I believe it was happening was the
following. The connection with the device was being created in a given event loop A, while the disconnection was being
 requested on event loop B. When the device replied back with telling the disconnection was successfully, that event
 was received in event loop A and not in event loop B. The event loop B was waiting for the reply event and,
 therefore, raised the timeout.
